###  Project Manager

This is a mini project that I created while learning TypeScript and React. Here you can keep a list of all the courses that you learn the given technology from.

This is a way to keep information of all the courses that you take part in or you will.

There is a list of technologies on the main page. You can add new technologies.
By clicking on a given technology, you can see a list of courses that you take as part of learning this technology.
